# GEEK info
# Graphs are data structures similar to trees. They differ
# in that graphs have a shape representative of what they model.

# With graphs nodes are called vertices and the lines connecting
# them are edges. Graphs are considered connected if there is one
# path from each vertex to each other vertex.

# Graphs don't have fixed organization like trees. Trees have
# a maximum of 2 children, but with graphs each vertex can
# connect to any number of other vertices.
