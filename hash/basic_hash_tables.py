# The positive of a Hash Table data structure is that
# they are fast at inserting and searching. The negative
# is that they are limited in size, are hard to resize,
# and don't work well unless each item is unique.

# A Hash Function is used to generate a unique key for
# every item in the list. Since every item is entered
# using a calculation, we can reverse the calculation
# to find the correct index.

# We have to take care that the unique key (Index) fits
# in the list and that it doesn't overwrite other data.

    # It doesn't make sense to make a 1000 item list
    # however use the mod function versus the
    # list size to make sure the items fit in our list.
    # Also goal is to make the list big enough to
    # avoid collisions but not so big that it wastes
    # memory. A collision occurs when we try to put a
    # value in an index that already has data stored.
