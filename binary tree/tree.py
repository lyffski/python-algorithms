# Root : Top Node of a Tree
# Path : Lines that Connect Nodes
# Leaf : Node without Children
# Subtree : Grouping of Parent Children in the Main Tree

# It is a tree thats nodes will only ever have 2 children and the
# child on the left will have a value < than parent, while
# the child on the right has a value > than the parent.
# Parents can however only have 1 child node

# Unbalanced Trees are trees in which most of the Nodes are
# on one side. They are bad because they are slow.

# Why Use Trees?
# Fast Search, Insert & Delete
# Ordered Arrays are Bad at Insert & Delete
# Linked List Searching is Slow
# Tree Operations are O(log N)
# Trees are More Efficient if Many Different Operations
# are Needed
