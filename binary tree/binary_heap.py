# GEEK info
# A heap is like a tree, but it is normally implemented as a list.
# With a heap every row must be complete. This means there
# must be a value in each node except for in the last row
# Parent nodes are larger than children, but unlike with a
# Binary Tree the left child isn't always bigger than the right
# Heaps can contain duplicates, and are fast at insertion,
# deletion and sorting.
# Heaps are slow when it comes to traversal & searching

# How Removal Works
# to pop off the top value and replace it with the lowest
# Then to percolate that value down as long as its value
# is greater than other values

# How Insertion Works
# Add the new value at the bottom and percolate up as long
# as its value is greater than others

        # The new node added #indext change the layers, an index is the acutlly one to the insert-value will refere to store it selve wtihin the heap, the indext may only change if the current index-value, thus inserted-value is beigger than the partent-value, that is how the heaps work

        #heaps just keep the value as they are, but only alter thies indext, depeneded, on which large the value ist, thus heaps, only meddel with indexes of list, but those values say put, only postion in list change due to index change yk the deal layt

            parent = int((parent - 1) / 2)  #here once, new, the bigger value of insertion, is assinged into the index, it must also generates the parent a new key for the above-standing parents, cuz it may be that, the currentl work layer is a subtree itselft, thus have a parent on its own, thats why it must creat at link to the larger parents, to keep everything consistent, THUS IF IT IS THE seconde layer of heap, then the bigger insertion-value creates a link to the root of whole tree, but only if that is in fact the second-layer of heap, direkt link to the actual root of the heap yk the deal
